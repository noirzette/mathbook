    <title>Runestone Testing</title>

    <introduction>
        <p>We collect Runestone interactive items for testing here, in sections of their own.</p>
    </introduction>

    <section>
        <title>ActiveCode</title>

        <p>Python program listings are automatically made interactive when HTML is produced for Runestone.</p>

        <listing xml:id="program-activecode">
            <caption>An interactive Python program, using <pubtitle>Runestone</pubtitle></caption>
            <program xml:id="python-hello-world" language="python">
                <input>
                print(3.2)
                print("Hello, World!")
                </input>

    <reading-questions>

        <exercise>
            <p>This is a simple question.  Does this look like a short answer question?</p>
        </exercise>

        <exercise>
            <p>And a second reading question, so we can test having more than one.  Specifically to be certain each goes into the manifest properly.  How about some math now, <m>a^2+b^2=c^2</m>.  Is that all right?</p>
